    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would first explain to my potential client, what could go wrong if a website is not protected, like it becoming unavailable, or displayed information might appear modified, or information associated with the website, like email, contact info, payment information, passwords, could be accessed by people which this information does not belong to. There is an aspect of protecting the company, and the company's users. By protecting the website we can prevent misuse of information from happening, or at least make it harder. There are mainly three kinds of threats to a website, cross site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and cross site request forgery (CSRF). In order to protect a webpage from these threats, there are practices that should be in place. Sanitization of data makes sure that the system will not just accept any input. By using a login protocol for the website we can ensure secure authentication and authorization. When using third party applications it is smart to choose one that is well known. A network will share data across nodes, but because of this it is important that the network is secure, so where to connect to and what host is used for the website is important. A user should also be automatically logged out after a certain time, to protect the users credentials. A secure website is paranoid about what comes from the browser, as this is where it might meet a user with bad intentions.</p>
